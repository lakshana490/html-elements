</p> <p class="example"> Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Vinayaka Chavithi or Vinayagar Chaturthi, is a Hindu festival
   that tributes Hindu deity Ganesha. The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesha's clay murtis (devotional
    representations of a deity) privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages).The festival
     celebrates Ganesha as the God of New Beginnings, the Remover of Obstacles and the God of Wisdom and Intelligence,
     [8][9] and is observed throughout the Indian subcontinent by Hindus, especially in the states such as Maharashtra,
      Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Goa,
       as well as Sri Lanka.[1][10] Ganesh Chaturthi is also observed by the Hindu diaspora elsewhere such as in
        Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, other 
        parts of the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa,[11] the United States, and Europe. In the Gregorian 
        calendar, Ganesh Chaturthi falls between 22 August and 20 September every year.
